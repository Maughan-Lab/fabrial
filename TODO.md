# Implement Widgets
- Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
    - Similarly to how you have an `Oven` class for the physical oven, you should make a `Potentiostat` class that gets created each time an **EIS** action is run, for each potentiostat. This means you can abstract things like running EIS.
    - This is partially complete. You can create a Potentiostat through the Gamry interface.
