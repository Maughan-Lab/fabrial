# Quincy-New
A full rewrite of Quincy using PyQt6.

Quincy is an application for controlling lab instruments. Currently, it supports lab ovens capable of communicating using modbus protocols.

# Notes for Developers
- This program uses PyInstaller to compile and InstallForge to create an installer.
    * An awesome reference for both programs can be found [here](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/packaging-pyqt6-applications-windows-pyinstaller/).
- You can add additional sequence builder items by following the instructions [here](/Developer%20README.md).
